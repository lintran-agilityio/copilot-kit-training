 * Rubric-based LLM judge for response-quality evals. Deliberately narrow:
 * the judge only ever answers "does every numbered rubric line hold?" — it
 * never free-scores "does this look good", which is exactly the kind of
 * flaky, unexplainable eval the brief asks to avoid. Reuses the same
 * `AI_MODEL` router the production agent resolves (see
 * `src/mastra/constants/model.ts`), so no separate provider/key is needed.
