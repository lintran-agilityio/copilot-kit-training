 * Optional `## GUEST` block prepended to the system prompt when the browser

 * booking ownership from it — the eval harness never sets `forwardedProps`, so
 * this is a no-op there and cannot shift deterministic runs. The locale is
 * explicitly subordinate to LANGUAGE SUPPORT (reply in the language of the
 * guest's latest message), so a `vi-VN` browser never flips an English chat.
 *
 * Prepended OUTSIDE buildHomestayAssistantPrompt / withDateContext so it never
 * disturbs the golden playbook section order.
