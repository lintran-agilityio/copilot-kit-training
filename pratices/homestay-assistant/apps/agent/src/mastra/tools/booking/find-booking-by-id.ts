If you only have a room name (no id), call find_bookings instead. For a guest-facing "show/list my bookings" request, call get_bookings instead — never this tool.
      - purpose selects CANCEL vs MODIFY eligibility rules; see the purpose parameter.
      - For MODIFY, also set requestedCheckInDate / requestedCheckOutDate / requestedGuests when the guest's LATEST message states a new value for that field. For a stated RELATIVE extend/shorten ("one more night", "extend 2 nights", "shorten by one night"), pass requestedCheckOutDeltaDays: N (negative to shorten) — do NOT compute a date; the app adds N to the resolved booking's current check-out.
